**Project Objective:**  The purpose of our project was to create machine learning models to analyze and predict  the diagnosis of heart disease in patients using labeled data.

**Conclusion**
We conclude that the best model for an application such as this is Random Forest. While all three models gave very similar results of 73-74%, Random forest is the best at handling the complexity that comes with so many features.
